# ASP.net Core Development Framework
###### Derived from NopCommerce

By fast growing of NopCommerce usage and numerous developers who are familier with this e-commerce solution and based on this fact that the design and architecture of this platform is well formed and very easy to understand and develop, I've derived this fundumental developement framework from [V4.1 of NopCommerce](https://github.com/nopSolutions/nopCommerce).
This solution is a boilerplate for creating any .net Core web application.
I'll adding some other capabilities and components to this premitive solution in future versions.
